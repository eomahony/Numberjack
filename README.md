# Numberjack
## A Python platform for Combinatorial Optimisation

## What is Numberjack?

Numberjack is a modelling package written in Python for combinatorial
optimisation. Python benefits from a large and active programming community,
Numberjack is therefore a perfect tool to embed optimisation technology into
larger applications. It is designed to support a number of underlying C/C++
solvers seamlessly and efficiently. There are a number of available back-ends:
three mixed integer programming solvers ([Gurobi][gurobiopt], [CPLEX][cplex],
and [SCIP][scipopt]), satisfiability solvers ([MiniSat][minisat],
[Walksat][walksat], and many others), a constraint programming solver (Mistral),
and a weighted constraint satisfaction solver ([Toulbar2][toulbar2]).

* Numberjack offers a high level constraint programming language
* Numberjack directly benefits from python's features and modules
* Numberjack uses efficient underlying C/C++ solvers.

## Installation

Numberjack offers the ability to use several high-performance solvers, some of
which are required to be installed separately or have their own dependencies.
The source-code for building Mistral, Toulbar2, Minisat, and Walksat is included
in the Numberjack distribution and interfaces to additional solvers are
available.

To install Numberjack from source simply run `python setup.py build` from the
Numberjack directory, followed by `python setup.py install`. This requires the
following to be installed:

* python-dev
* swig (3.X)
* libxml2-dev
* zlib1g-dev 
* libgmp-dev

## Building the Solver Interfaces

The following solvers are entirely optional and are not required to use
Numberjack however they can be a valuable tool to have. If any of the solvers
cannot be found on the system, then their interface will be disabled within
Numberjack.


### Gurobi Optimizer

Numberjack provides an interface to the mathematical programming solver,
[Gurobi][gurobiopt]. To use it in Numberjack, [Download and install Gurobi
Optimizer][gurobiopt] from their website. Numberjack has been tested against
Gurobi versions 5.1, 5.5, and 5.6.

Numberjack will try to automatically find the Gurobi install location by first
checking the `GUROBI_HOME` environment variable which should be set according to
the Gurobi install guide. If not, it will try to find the path based on the
location of the `gurobi_cl` executable.

```bash
export GUROBI_HOME="/opt/gurobi550/linux64"    # Example Linux install dir
export GUROBI_HOME="/Library/gurobi550/mac64"  # Example Mac OS X install dir
```

### CPLEX

Numberjack provides an interface to [IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimizer][cplex] and has
been tested against CPLEX versions 12.5, and 12.5.1.

Numberjack will try to automatically find the CPLEX install location by first
checking the environment variable `CPLEXDIR`. If this is not set it will try to
find it based on the location of the `cplex` executable.

```bash
export CPLEXDIR="/opt/ibm/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio1251/cplex"
export CPLEXDIR="/Applications/IBM/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio1251/cplex"
```

### SCIP

SCIP is an open-source MIP solver available from: [http://scip.zib.de][scipopt],
please download version 3.1.0. The simplest way to install SCIP is to [download
the source code of SCIP Optimization Suite v3.1.0][scipoptdl] and place
scipoptsuite-3.1.0.tgz in the same folder as Numberjack, alongside this file, so
that it can be compiled with the necessary flags.

If you would like to compile SCIP yourself from a different location, then
please set the environment variable `ZIBPATH` to the scipoptsuite directory and
compile the static library using the following options:

```bash
export ZIBPATH=path_to/scipoptsuite-3.1.0
make scipoptlib ZIMPL=false ZLIB=false READLINE=false GAMS=false GMP=false LEGACY=true SPX_LEGACY=true
```

[scipoptdl]: http://scip.zib.de/download.php?fname=scipoptsuite-3.1.0.tgz


### Compiling Specific Solvers
If you add one of these solvers after already installing Numberjack,
you can compile a subset of the solvers by specifying a comma separated list
with the `-solver` argument, for example:

```bash
python setup.py build -solver Mistral,SCIP,MiniSat
```


### OSI Solvers
_The following OSI solvers have not been ported to the distutils build system yet._

Before you get started with the compiling Osi solvers for Numberjack you must first get the Osi module working.

Download Osi from: [http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Osi/][osi]

To do this you need to download Osi-???.tgz and extract it in the solvers/osi/ folder.
The version that the Makefile presumes is Osi-0.105.2. If you download a different version the line `OSIVER = 0.105.2` will have to be changed.

#### OsiClp
Download Clp from: [http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Clp/][osiclp]

The version that the Makefile presumes is Clp-1.14.5. If you download a different version the line `CLPVER = 1.14.5` will have to be changed.

#### OsiCbc
Download Cbc from: [http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Cbc/][osicbc]

The version that the Makefile presumes is Cbc-2.7.5. If you download a different version the line `CBCVER = 2.7.5` will have to be changed.

CBC Supports several different lp solver backends(_e.g. glpk_) but currently dynamically links Clp.
There will be some work done on this, but as it stands you need to have Clp installed to the system for CBC to work.

#### OsiVol
Download Vol from: [http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Vol/][osivol]

The version that the Makefile presumes is Vol-1.3.2. If you download a different version the line `VOLVER = 1.3.2` will have to be changed.

#### OsiDylp
Download Dylp from: [http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Dylp/][osidylp]

The version that the Makefile presumes is DyLP-1.8.2. If you download a different version the line `DYLPVER = 1.8.2` will have to be changed.

#### OsiSpx (soplex)
Download soplex from: [http://soplex.zib.de/download.shtml][soplex]

The version that the Makefile presumes is soplex-1.6.0. If you download a different version the line `SPXVER = 1.6.0` will have to be changed.

#### OsiGlpk
Download Glpk from: [http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/glpk/][glpk]

The version that the Makefile presumes is glpk-4.47. If you download a different version the line `GLPKVER = 4.47` will have to be changed.
